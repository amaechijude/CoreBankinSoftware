Here's a high-level overview of a typical funds transfer flow for your Nigerian core banking microservices architecture:

## Current Flow Analysis

Your three-step flow is a good start, but let's expand it into a complete end-to-end process:

## Complete Funds Transfer Flow

### **Phase 1: Pre-Transaction (Name Enquiry)**
1. **Account Lookup/Name Enquiry**
   - User inputs destination account number
   - Request routes through YARP Gateway → Account Service
   - Validate account exists, is active, and can receive funds
   - Return account holder name for confirmation
   - **Important**: This should be a separate, lightweight operation

### **Phase 2: Transaction Initiation**
2. **Balance Check** (Internal - Backend)
   - When user initiates transfer, Transaction Service requests sender's available balance
   - Account Service returns available balance (actual balance minus holds/liens)
   - Validate sufficient funds exist

3. **User Authorization**
   - User inputs amount and optional narration
   - User provides authentication (PIN, OTP, biometric, etc.)
   - Validate authorization credentials

### **Phase 3: Transaction Processing**
4. **Transaction Validation**
   - Validate amount limits (minimum/maximum transfer limits)
   - Check daily/monthly transaction limits for the sender
   - Verify sender account is not restricted/frozen
   - Check for duplicate transactions (idempotency)
   - Fraud/AML checks if applicable

5. **Fund Reservation (Critical)**
   - Place a **hold/lien** on sender's account for the transfer amount
   - This prevents double-spending if multiple transactions attempt simultaneously
   - Account Service should support this operation

6. **Transaction Execution**
   - **Debit sender account** (Transaction Service → Account Service)
   - **Credit destination account** (Transaction Service → Account Service)
   - Both operations should be part of a **distributed transaction/saga pattern**
   - Generate unique transaction reference

7. **Transaction Recording**
   - Record transaction in Transaction Service database
   - Update account balances in Account Service
   - Release the hold/lien after successful debit

### **Phase 4: Post-Transaction**
8. **Notification**
   - Send SMS/Email/Push notification to sender (debit alert)
   - Send SMS/Email/Push notification to recipient (credit alert)
   - Include transaction reference, amount, balance

9. **Receipt Generation**
   - Generate transaction receipt with full details
   - Store for audit trail

## Key Points You're Missing

### **1. Distributed Transaction Management**
- Use **Saga Pattern** (choreography or orchestration) to handle the debit/credit across services
- Handle rollback scenarios if credit fails after debit
- Implement compensation transactions

### **2. Idempotency**
- Prevent duplicate transactions if user clicks multiple times
- Use idempotency keys/transaction references
- Check for duplicate requests within a time window

### **3. Concurrency Control**
- Handle simultaneous transactions on the same account
- Implement optimistic or pessimistic locking
- Fund reservation/holds are critical here

### **4. Intra-bank vs Inter-bank Transfers**
- Your flow will differ for internal (same bank) vs external transfers
- Inter-bank requires NIBSS NIP integration
- Consider different processing times and settlement windows

### **5. Transaction Limits & Rules**
- Daily/monthly transaction limits per account/customer tier
- Single transaction amount limits
- Velocity checks (number of transactions in timeframe)

### **6. Audit Trail & Compliance**
- Every step should be logged for regulatory compliance
- Immutable transaction records
- Support for transaction queries and disputes

### **7. Error Handling & User Experience**
- Failed transaction reversals
- Timeout handling (what if credit service is down?)
- Clear error messages to users
- Transaction status tracking (pending, successful, failed, reversed)

### **8. Security Considerations**
- Rate limiting at gateway level
- Transaction authorization (PIN/OTP/2FA)
- Session management and timeout
- Encryption of sensitive data in transit

### **9. Fee Management**
- Transaction fees (if applicable)
- Fee deduction logic (from sender or recipient?)
- VAT on fees

### **10. Asynchronous Processing Considerations**
- Some operations (notifications, reporting) can be async via message queues
- Consider eventual consistency trade-offs
- Use event-driven architecture for cross-service communication

## Recommended Architecture Pattern

For the actual transaction execution, consider:
- **Orchestration Saga**: Transaction Service acts as orchestrator
- **Event Sourcing**: Store all transaction events for complete audit trail
- **CQRS**: Separate read models for balance queries vs write models for transactions
- **Message Queue**: Use RabbitMQ/Kafka for inter-service communication and async operations
